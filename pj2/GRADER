Name of student running submit: Woody Chung
Login of student running submit: cs61b-aqa

Second team member's name: Vidush Mukund

Third team member's name (if any): Sam Holladay
Third team member's login: cs61b-dm

IMPORTANT:  Once you've submitted Project 2 once, the same team member should
submit always.  If a different teammate must submit, inform cs61b@cory.eecs of
all the details.  Include a complete list of team members, and let us know
which submission you want graded.

If you've submitted your project once, or even written a substantial amount of
code together, you may not change partners without the permission of the
instructor.
===============================================================================
Does your program compile without errors?


Have you tested your program on the 61B lab machines?


Did you successfully implement game tree search?  Did you successfully
implement alpha-beta pruning?  Are there any limitations on it?  What is the
default number of search levels set by the one-parameter MachinePlayer
constructor (or is it a variable-depth search)?


Describe your board evaluation function in some detail.


Does your MachinePlayer use any special method of choosing the first few moves?


Is there anything else the graders should know to help them read your project?



Describe the classes, modules, and interfaces you designed before and while you
implemented the project.  Your description should include:
  -  A list of the classes your program uses.
  -  A list of each of the "modules" used in or by MachinePlayer, similar to
     the list in the "Teamwork" section of the README (but hopefully more
     detailed).  (If you're using a list class, that should probably count as
     a separate module.)
  -  For each module, list the class(es) the module is implemented in.
  -  For each module, say which of your team members implemented it.
  -  For each module, describe its interface--specifically, the prototype and
     behavior of each method that is available for external callers (outside
     the module) to call.  Don't include methods that are only meant to be
     called from within the module.

     For each method, provide (1) a method prototype and (2) a complete,
     unambiguous description of the behavior of the method/module.  This
     description should also appear before the method in your code's comments.

You will probably need to change some of your design decisions as you go; be
sure to modify this file to reflect these changes before you submit your
project.  Your design of classes and interfaces will be worth 10% of your
grade.

CLASSES

public class Best() 
public class Board() 
public class PlayerNetwork()

BEST CLASS
  // Field. Move for this class.
  Move move;
  // Field. Score of this move.
  int score;


PLAYERNETWORK CLASS

  // Field. Player this network is describing.
  protected MachinePlayer player;
  
  // Method
  // Constructor of this player's network.
  public PlayerNetwork(MachinePlayer thisPlayer)
  
  // Method
  // Implements minimax alpha-beta search algorithm, based on lecture pseudocode.
  // Searches game tree of this board, to a given searchDepth.
  // The scores of each Best move are obtained from evaluateBoard.
  // Implemented by: Vidush Mukund
  public Best searchTree(int alpha, int beta, int searchDepth, Board board)

  // Method
  // Returns true if the given Move move is valid on the given Board board. False if invalid.
  // Implemented by: Woody Chung
  public boolean isValidMove(Move move, Board board) 
  
  // Method
  // Returns an array of all valid moves on the given board. Uses isValidMove to check.
  // Used in the searchTree method.
  // Implemented by: Woody Chung
  public Move[] getValidMoves(Board board) 
  
  
BOARD() CLASS

  // Field: Board is 8x8 array of bools. Null means empty; true means this player occupies; false means opponent player occupies.
  protected boolean[][] board;
  // Field: which player this board describes.
  protected MachinePlayer player;

  // Method
  // Constructor, creates an empty board for this player (all values are null).
  // Implemented by: Sam Holladay
  public Board(MachinePlayer thisPlayer) 
  
  // Method
  // Sets the given square to the color of this player.
  // Implemented by: Vidush Mukund
  public void setSquare(int x, int y) 

  // Method
  // Returns value of current ("this") board. Assigns maximum positive values to win by side,
  // minimum negative values to win by opponent. Intermediate values to board where neither
  // player has committed a network. 
  // Implemented by: Sam Holladay
  public double evaluateBoard()
  
  // Method
  // Determines whether Board board contains any winning networks for the given player.
  // Algorithm returns true if the board has a winning network, and false if it doesn't.
  // Implemented by: Woody Chung
  public boolean hasWinningNetwork()
